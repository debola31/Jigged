-- ============================================================================
-- SHORT-CLOSE REPLACES SCRAP ON AN OUTSIDE RECEIPT
-- ============================================================================
-- `outside_shipment_receipts.quantity_scrapped` recorded what a vendor lost, so
-- that 100 out and 98 back stopped reading as "2 still at the plater". It goes.
--
-- WHY IT WAS THE WRONG SHAPE. Two reasons, and the second is the one that
-- settles it:
--
--   1. It disagreed with our own model. `job_operation_completions` is
--      deliberately GOOD-ONLY -- 20260721023953's header states `quantity_scrap`
--      is deferred -- so an outside op could record scrap and an in-house op
--      could not, for the same physical event.
--
--   2. It is not how the trade does it. A short receipt is resolved by CLOSING
--      THE LINE, not by reconciling a scrap number: Sage 300 short-closes a PO
--      (set completed, outstanding to 0); Oracle closes when received >= ordered
--      LESS QUANTITY CANCELLED; SAP handles component loss as a BOM/consumption
--      adjustment, which is a different mechanism entirely and not a per-receipt
--      field.
--
-- So the shortfall becomes a STATE on the slip -- "that is everything we are
-- getting" -- rather than a quantity somebody has to reconcile. One action
-- instead of a number, and it is the action every ERP in this space already has.
--
-- The 2 pieces are still lost; the shop still re-runs them or drops the order
-- quantity. What changes is that the slip can be settled, so a written-off
-- shortfall stops sitting on the chase list forever.
-- ============================================================================


-- ---- 1. The receipt is good-only, like its in-house sibling -----------------

-- recreated without the column in section 4.

This is Sage''s short-close and Oracle''s quantity-cancelled, and it replaces a per-receipt scrap number (dropped 20260906005725). Voiding is different and stays different: a void says the send never counted; a close says it counted and is finished.';
